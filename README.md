A Node.js implementation of the [LIFX protocol](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs). Developed to work with a minimum firmware version of 2.0.

This library is not, in any way, affiliated or related to LiFi Labs, Inc.. Use it at your own risk.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install node-lifx --save
```

## Compatibility

Node.js 0.12+ and io.js are tested and supported on Mac, Linux and Windows.

## Usage
The file `cli.js` contains a working example.

### Client
The library uses a client for network communication. This client handles communication with all lights in the network.
```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

client.init();
```
The `Client` object is an EventEmitter and emmits events whenever any changes occur. This can be a new light discovery, a light sending a message or similar.  
The client starts discovery of lights right after it is initialized with the `init` method. If a new light is found the client emmits a `light-new` event. This event contains the light as an object on which methods can be called then:

```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

client.on('light-new', function(light) {
  // Change light state here
});

client.init();
```

### Changing light state
The states of a light can be changed with different methods:

#### `light.on([duration], [callback])`
This turns a light on.

Option | Type | Default | Description
------ | ---- | ------- | -----------
`duration` | int | 0 | Turning on will be faded over the time (in milliseconds).
`callback` | function | null | `function(error) {}` Called after the command has reached the light or after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not. `error` is `null` in case of success and given if the sending has failed.
_Note: Using callback multiplies network load for this command by two or more times._

Usage examples:
```js
light.on(); // Turns the light off instantly
light.on(2000); // Fading the light off over two seconds
```

#### `light.off([duration], [callback])`
This turns a light off.

Option | Type | Default | Description
------ | ---- | ------- | -----------
`duration` | int | 0 | Turning off will be faded over the time (in milliseconds).
`callback` | function | null | `function(error) {}` Called after the command has reached the light or after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not. `error` is `null` in case of success and given if the sending has failed.
_Note: Using callback multiplies network load for this command by two or more times._

Usage examples:
```js
light.off(); // Turns the light off instantly
light.off(2000); // Fading the light off over two seconds
```

#### `light.color(hue, saturation, brightness, [kelvin], [duration], [callback])`
Changes the color off a light.

Option | Type | Default | Description
------ | ---- | ------- | -----------
`hue` | int | | Between 0 and 360, representing the color hue in degree which changes the color.
`saturation` | int | | Between 0 and 100, representing the color intensity from 0% to 100%.
`brightness` | int | | Between 0 and 100, representing the light brightness from 0% to 100%.
`kelvin` | int | 3500 | Between 2500 and 9000, representing the color temperature.
`duration` | int | 0 | Fade the color to the new value over time (in milliseconds).
`callback` | function | null | `function(error) {}` Called after the command has reached the light or after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not. `error` is `null` in case of success and given if the sending has failed.
_Note: Using callback multiplies network load for this command by two or more times._

Usage examples:
```js
light.color(0, 100, 50); // Set to red at 50% brightness
light.color(50, 50, 80, 3500, 2000); // Set to a light green at 80% brightness over next two seconds
```

### Requesting light state and info

### Client events
The following events might be thrown by the client.

#### `light-new`
This event is thrown when there is a new light discovery that has not been seen at runtime before. This event is provided with the new light object.  
`client.on('light-new', function(light) {});`

#### `light-offline`
This event is thrown when a light hasn't been discovered for a time. The light given is no longer expected to be reachable.  
`client.on('light-offline', function(light) {});`

#### `light-online`
This event is thrown when a light is discovered again after being offline.  
`client.on('light-online', function(light) {});`

### Start / Stop discovery
The discovery for each client can be started and stopped at runtime using these commands:

#### `client.startDiscovery()`
Starts the discovery process.

#### `client.stopDiscovery()`
Stops the discovery process.

### Client settings
For the initialization of the client different settings can be provided. This is an example with the default options:

```js
var LifxClient = require('node-lifx').Client;
var client = new LifxClient();

// ...

client.init({
  lightOfflineTolerance: 3, // A light is offline if not seen for the given amount of discoveries
  messageHandlerTimeout: 45000, // in ms, if not answer in time an error is provided to get methods
  startDiscovery: true, // start discovery after initialization
  resendPacketDelay: 150, // delay between packages if light did not receive a packet (for setting methods with callback)
  resendMaxTimes: 3, // resend packages x times if light did not receive a packet (for setting methods with callback)
  debug: false, // logs all messages in console if turned on
  address: '0.0.0.0', // the IPv4 address to bind the udp connection to
  broadcast: '255.255.255.255', // set's the IPv4 broadcast address which is addressed to discover bulbs
  lights: [] // Can be used provide a list of known light IPv4 ip addresses if broadcast packets in network are not allowed
             // For example: ['192.168.0.112', '192.168.0.114'], this will then be addressed directly
});
```
